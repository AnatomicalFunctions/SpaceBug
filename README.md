# Final Project: SPACEBUG

## Instructions:

You command an Alliance “Space Bug” Starfighter,

An enemy Missile Cruiser has been spotted in your sector! You’ve been tasked to intercept and destroy it with your autocannon.

It is slow moving, but it is equipped with radar-guided missiles that will destroy you if you cannot evade them! 

Shoot the missiles down, lead them into the boundary of the play area, or throw them off your trail by deploying chaff countermeasures and making sharp turns.

The missiles grow more red as they approach time-out and explode.

Chaff can only be deployed after the previous deployment has disappeared. Use sparingly.

Good luck!

## Controls:

* A = Turn Left
* D = Turn Right
* W = Fire Foward Guns
* CTRL = Deploy Chaff

* SPACE = restart
* ESC = close

## Grading:

This is a massive project, with significant changes since the last submitted iteration as detailed in the demo video. I am going for the "Large - 200pt" submission, and am hoping for 61 points, despite my lack of a proposal, for which I expect to lose a number of points.
