## Instructions:

You command an Alliance “Space Bug” Starfighter,

An enemy Missile Cruiser has been spotted in your sector! You’ve been tasked to intercept and destroy it with your autocannon.

It is slow moving, but it is equipped with radar-guided missiles that will destroy you if you cannot evade them! 

Shoot the missiles down, lead them into the boundary of the play area, or throw them off your trail by deploying chaff countermeasures and making sharp turns.

The missiles grow more red as they approach time-out and explode.

Chaff can only be deployed after the previous deployment has disappeared. Use sparingly.

Good luck!

## Controls:

* A = Turn Left
* D = Turn Right
* W = Fire Foward Guns
* SHIFT = Deploy Chaff

* SPACE = restart
* ESC = close

## Core Principles:

* Generation and linking of quadratic functions that define the movement of all game objects.
* Numerical analysis to find equally spaced points relative to the curve.
* Free movement in 2D space.
* Efficient collision detection of two rectangles at any rotation.
* Missile seeker cones of detection for realistic chaff.
* Various interesting interactions with the function generation tools, such as:
  * Player input determining function generation.
  * Game State determining generation.
  * Preset animations determining various generations, such as chaff or directional explosions
